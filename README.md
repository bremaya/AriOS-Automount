# Arios Automount
Automatically mounts all local partitions upon login in GNOME. It does that without touching /etc/fstab. Automount can be enabled/disabled from the Administration menu. Originally built for AriOS http://arioslinux.org.

This is a personal project, and I'm not related with Hamid Azimy <hamid.azimy@gmail.com> or AriOS Team (http://arioslinux.org). Just install in a Linux-Based System derivated of Debian (for while I only pack the .deb installer), especially created for use in Ubuntu 20.10 and +.

This program is packed only for use in Debian-Based liked Systems.

Any problems mail to > bremaya@gmail.com
