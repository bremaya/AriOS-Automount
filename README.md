# Arios-Automount
Automatically mounts all local partitions upon login in GNOME. It does that without touching /etc/fstab. Automount can be enabled/disabled from the Administration menu. Originally built for AriOS http://arioslinux.org.

This is a personal project, and I'm not related with AriOS Team (http://arioslinux.org). Just install in a Linux-Based System derivated of Debian (for while I only pack the .deb x64 installer)

This is packed only for Debian-Based Systems 64Bit.

Any problems mail to > bremaya@gmail.com
